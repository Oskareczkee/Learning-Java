# World Simulator
[Add screen here]
This is simple project written as an assignment job in Java. It "Simulates" World. This is simple version, not developed much.  
It uses Swing library to create Console log and game window. Game window is hand-written JComponent with custom rendering. It includes simple Action system, interface to render world and interface
to implement new entities

## Further development
Further development is not in the plans. I would rather want to create custom project in Unity to learn it, rather than developing this. Still cool experience in writing my own usable rendering and
interface to add new content
